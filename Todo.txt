maybe move bodies in iterations?
maybe in uncollide bodies dont move if movement causes collision?
maybe shader physics?
maybe bodies handle their bounce and friction themselves?

SoftBody should check which of if points are inside the other body in uncollide
force under certain treshold should not apply

bug: softbodies interect wrong with non convex shapes
bug: non convex shapes apply wrong (friction?/rotation?)
bug: big delta causes violent behaviour
